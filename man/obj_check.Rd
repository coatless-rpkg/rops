\usage{
x \%==\% y

x \%!=\% y
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{two data structures}
}
\description{
Short-hand declarations for checking whether x is equivalent to y
}
\details{
\code{\link{identical}} function tests for an exact match meaning that
the variable's storage types match, the overall environment the variable
is stored in is the same, and, most importantly, there is no tolerance
for small numerical differences.

When in doubt, consult \code{\link{all.equal}} to perform near equality tests
using a tolerance operation (e.g does a number fall within a certain range).
However, the use of \code{\link{all.equal}} must be enclosed within
\code{\link{isTRUE}} as the function is setup to return \emph{differences}.

\examples{
# Generate some data
set.seed(991)
x <- y <- rnorm(100)

# Returns TRUE as the objects are exactly the same
x \%==\% y

# Returns FALSE as the objects differ.
x \%!=\% y

# Change data
x2 = x+1

# Returns FALSE as the data has changed.
x2 \%==\% y

# Returns TRUE since the data is different.
x2 \%!=\% y
