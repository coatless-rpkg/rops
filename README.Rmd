# R Ops (`rops`)

The objective behind this package is to provide an extension to base *R* that
supplements present operators manipulations.


# Supported Functionality

Presently, the package has support for the following operators:

- [Null coalescing operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator): `%??%`
     - Operator to allow checking and substitution if a value is null without `if`/`else` structure 
- Missing value (`NA`) coalescing operator: `ifna(x, y)`
     - Substitute value when NA is detected.
- [Is Whole Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer): `is_whole(x)`
     - Vectorized boolean operator to assess whether value is an integer.
- Safe Sequence Generation: `from %:% to`, `safe_seq(from, to, by)`
- Not In Set: `%notin%`
