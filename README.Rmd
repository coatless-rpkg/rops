# R Ops (`rops`)

The objective behind this package is to provide an extension to base *R* that
supplements present operators manipulations.


# Supported Functionality

Presently, the package has support for the following operators:

- [Null coalescing operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator): `%??%`
     - Operator to allow checking and substitution if a value is null without `if`/`else` structure 
     
- [Missing value (`NA`) coalescing operator](): `ifna(x,y)`
     - Substitute value when NA is detected.

- [Is Whole Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer): `is_whole(x)`
     - Vectorized boolean operator to assess whether value is an integer.
